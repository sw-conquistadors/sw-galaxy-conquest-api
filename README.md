# SW:GC API

## Project Description
Galactic Conquest is a small server based browser game in which a player attempts to take over the galaxy. The player takes command of their home planet and a small fleet of ships which they then use to take over enemy planets. The planets and the information about each planet the player travels to are retrieved via the Star Wars API. The player wins when they have taken over more planets in the galaxy than their opponent. 

This is the backend API that stores the User, Galaxy, and Planet data.
